A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) theme for the Catppuccin soothing pastel theme.
Check out the various [examples](/components/) to see the theme in action.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Steps>

1. The Starlight Catppuccin theme is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="@catppuccin/starlight" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightCatppuccin from '@catppuccin/starlight'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightCatppuccin()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the theme in action.

4. (Optional) Customize your theme for light/dark mode using `flavor` and `accent`.

   ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" ins={10-11}
   import starlightCatppuccin from "@catppuccin/starlight";

   export default defineConfig({
     // ...
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         // ...
         plugins: [
           starlightCatppuccin({
             dark: { flavor: "macchiato", accent: "sky" },
             light: { flavor: "latte", accent: "sky" },
           }),
         ],
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

   You can find all available options in our [configuration reference](/configuration).

</Steps>

That's it! You should now see the Starlight Catppuccin theme applied to your Starlight website.
